''''
A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to
any node in the list or null.

Return a deep copy of the list.

The Linked List is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes.
Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

val: an integer representing Node.val
random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) where random pointer points to,
or null if it does not point to any node.'''
